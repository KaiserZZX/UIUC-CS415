## MP2: Level Design MP
This MP aims to enhance our ability to design the game for different level.  
I think my game is lack of positive feedback, but is also interesting at all.
Time spend: 30 hours -> implementing elements-10hr + level combination design 20hr
The link of my MP2 contains the project file and the describtion for level design.
